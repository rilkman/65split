# 65 Split
This is a 65% split bluetooth wireless keyboard I designed and created for a friend. This was also my first time creating a PCB and decided this would be a relatively easy project after making several handwired keyboards.  

The keyboard uses open source ZMK firmware.

# Layout

This layout was originally designed to be used on MacOS, however, the layout is easily editable through the ZMK config.
